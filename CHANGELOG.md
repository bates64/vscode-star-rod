## 1.6.0

- Added a new command, _Open Enums..._, which lets you quickly view enum files even if they are not in the mod globals folder.

## 1.5.1

- Enums are now loaded from Star Rod's database if they are not found in your mod's `globals/enum` folder

## 1.5.0

- Added support for Star Rod 0.5.0

## 1.4.1

- Fixed enums in subdirectories not being suggested
- Exported structs from global patch files are now shown in suggestions for other global patch files (previously, viewing exported global patch structs was limited to non-global patch files)

## 1.4.0

- Added support for Star Rod 0.4.4
- Fixed highlighting of `#export:Type $identifier` in patch files

## 1.3.0

- Added syntax highlighting for the [decompilation's .msg format](https://github.com/ethteck/papermario/pull/117)

## 1.2.1

- Fixed documentation comments being ignored.
- Fixed syntax highlighting for `@ $identifier` where the space between `@` and `$` is omitted.

## 1.2.0

- Normalised syntax highlighting among every `$identifier` regardless of type.
- Strings now use the 'text' icon when appearing in autocomplete suggestions.
- Structs declared or patched in the current file are now shown in the _Outline_ (bottom of the sidebar) and can be jumped to with _Go To Symbol in Editor..._ (Ctrl+Shift+O, or Ctrl+P then `@`).
- Added syntax highlighting for `#new:VertexTable` blocks.
- Fixed syntax highlighting for the `LT` branch/jump instructions in functions.
- Fixed `}` not being included in the highlighted range of Go To Definition.
- You can now document structs using any line comments, rather than just those prefixed with `!`.
- Made struct parsing more lenient - a comment between the header line and the comment block is now read correctly.
- Struct types are now displayed for functions and scripts, instead of `scr`, `api`, or `asm`. The distinction between the latter two is still maintained, however, in autocomplete.
- Improved type detection for functions. Functions in `$snake_case` are assumed to be for assembly (`JAL $func`) only, whereas functions in `$PascalCase` are assumed to be for script use (`Call $Func`) only.

## 1.1.0

- Added syntax highlighting for `#new:String` blocks.
- Added support for Star Rod 0.3.2.
- Added autocompletion for enum namespaces and enum members. Note that enum files in Star Rod's local `database` are not read, only those in your mod folder (`globals/enum/`).
- Added syntax highlighting for `#alias` directives.
- New syntactic analysis features (0.3.0+ only):
    - Added CodeLens actions on `#new` directives in src/gen files. This will add to, or create, the relevant `patch` file.
    - You can now use any number of `%!` line comments before a struct to document it. This info will appear in autocomplete suggestions and whenever you hover over the struct name.
    - Added autocompletion for map/area/game/mod flags and vars.
    - Added autocompletion and Go To Definition (hold Ctrl and click) for structs, including from other files (i.e. `src`, `gen`, `#import`ed files, and global patches).
- Disabled autocompletion features in string blocks.
- Extension now reloads when the Star Rod directory or version is changed in Settings.

## 1.0.3

- Added support for Star Rod 0.3.1.
- Unknown StarRod.jar files are now assumed to be the latest supported SR version.

## 1.0.2

- Removed a broken mod folder version failsafe

## 1.0.1

- Fixed syntax version detection to use the Star Rod directory version rather than `BuildVersion` from `mod.cfg`
- Published on https://open-vsx.org (e.g. for VSCodium users) as well as the Visual Studio Marketplace

## 1.0.0

Stable release! No significant/breaking changes despite the major version bump.

- Added support for Star Rod 0.3.0.

## 0.11.1

- Added support for `{scope=pause}` in the database library and its associated file extensions (`pscr`, `ppat`).
- The database is now reloaded when `starRod` configuration changes.
- Fixed `Jump` syntax highlighting and autocomplete.
- Fixed `@Script` blocks in global patches not being treated as scripts by autocomplete etc.
- Fixed `Npc` structs not being recognised.
- Fixed `#new:Function` blocks in global patches not being highlighted when a scope (e.g. `:Battle`) is used.

## 0.11.0

- Added syntax highlighting support for SR 0.3's RAM global patches e.g. `@Hook:Map`.
- Added autocomplete for `~Func:` expressions similar to `Call` in scripts.
- Added the `starRod.installDirectoryVersionOverride` configuration option.

## 0.10.2

- Fixed indented block directives such as `@` and `#new` not being highlighted
- Fixed identifier highlighting in `Set` expressions
- Fixed highlighting of `>=` operator
- Fixed highlighting of the last colon in multi-argument expressions: i.e. `{expression:arg:arg}` and `~expression:arg:arg`

## 0.10.1

- Updated database syntax highlighting
- Fixed typo in message when database args are marked `{raw}`
- Fixed indentation rules (e.g. behaviour of the _Reindent Lines_ command)

## 0.10.0

- Added support for Star Rod 0.3.0-beta0
    - Unlike with Star Rod 0.2.0, the database used for function signature documentation is actually provided by the files in your Star Rod `database` folder.
- Added an _Open Database..._ command which lets you quickly view the database files Star Rod is using. Syntax highlighting has been added for these files also.
- Syntax highlighting for `mod.cfg`, `main.cfg`, `GameFlags.txt`, and `GameBytes.txt`.
- Better syntax highlighting for `*.enum` files.
- Many syntax highlighting fixes.

## 0.9.1

- Fixed an issue with _Compile Mod_ where compilation would be aborted if the output from Star Rod was greater than 1 MB. The new limit is 4 MB - please tell me if your mod hits this limit (you'll get an `stdout maxBuffer length exceeded` error) and I can raise it.

## 0.9.0

- Added _Run Mod_, a command that runs the compiled mod in an emulator. You may need to set `starRod.emulatorPath` in your preferences.

## 0.8.0

- Added _Compile Mod_ and _Compile Map..._ commands. Use `Ctrl+P` and type 'Star Rod' to use them.
- Added an option to disable showing script keyword documentation when they are hovered over.
- Added a prompt to set the Star Rod installation directory if it is unset or invalid.
- Fixed syntax highlighting for `#new:Script_Main`, `#new:Function_Init`, `#new:Script:Global`, etc.

## 0.7.0

- Huge improvements to the accuracy and completeness of syntax highlighting
    - Many scopes (what things are marked as) have changed, which means the colors you see due to your theme may have changed
    - :rocket: A custom color scheme will be coming in the next release to take advantage of the greater accuracy of the new scopes. For example, assembly instructions/registers will be highlighted differently depending on their group
- Typing at the start of a line no longer suggests script commands if you are not in a script

## 0.6.0

- Updated intellisense hugely :sparkles:
    - Function database updated to Star Rod 0.2.0
    - Hovering over `{Func:XXX}` in functions to get its documentation now works
    - Script commands (`Call`, `Set`, etc.) are now autocompleted and have attached documentation
        - This includes snippets for complex commands such as `Bind` - press Tab to have the syntax filled-in for you
    - You can also hover over script commands to see documentation and examples
    - Hovering over a raw-addressed `Call` now gives the name of the function if it is known
    - Generated function signature/documentation bugfixes
- Code folding is now "smart" rather than indentation-based
    - This includes folding `/%...%/` block comments, `#import` series, and entire structs/strings
- Indentation/unindentation occurs automatically when "If," "EndIf", etc are used
    - `#new:Script` and `#new:Function` are deliberately not indented as to do so would be inconsistent with other structs
- Script commands outside of `#new:Script`/`@` blocks anyway to reduce flicker when enter is pressed to create a newline
    - In the future, an error will be raised upon saving the file if there are script commands outside of a script block
- Fixed some syntax highlighting issues, including `#new:Data` not being recognised & PAUSE/CHOICE in strings

## 0.5.1

Syntax highlighting:
- Fixed double-precision floats (e.g. `1.0d`)
- Fixed script/function lines with numeric offsets having their operation/mnemonic mishighlighted
- Fixed highlighting of pointer offsets such as `LTW v0, v0 ($MyStruct)`
- Updated numeric constant to not highlight errors such as `FFFFb` as numbers (`b`, for example, requires __at most__ 2 hex digits before it)

## 0.5.0

Syntax highlighting:
- All struct types such as `#new:Function_GetTattle` are now recgonised
- Script keywords `Call`, `Exec`, and `ExecWait` are now highlighted in italics
- Script keywords `ConstAND`, `ConstOR`, `DoesScriptExist`, and `Kill` are now recgonised
- Phrases such as `TODO` and `FIXME` are now highlighted when they appear in comments
- The numeric suffixes `` ` ``, `b`, and `s` are now highlighted differently from the number value itself
- Fixed unknown struct types being highlighted as if they were arbitrary data
- Fixed floating-point literals using only binary digits (e.g. `10.0`) being highlighted incorrectly past the decimal point
